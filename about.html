                        <p class="page">
                            I am Gcobisa Nkonzo, a 20 year old female with a great passion for technology and computers.
                        </p>
                        <p class="page">
                            I came to the Life Choices Academy seeking guidance and knowledge of the web development industry. I had a bit of multimedia background which I had studied as a module in 2015 as a  module during my first year as an IT student in the Cape Peninsula University of Technology.
                        </p>
                        <p class="page">
                             I saw an advert on the Life Choices and CodeSpace Web Development course and followed the instructions on how to apply. At this point I had no knowledge as to what the course was really about.
                                I then received and email with a link to the online test which I very much enjoyed to a point where I began doing some research on the internet about what Life Choices is all about.

                            A few weeks later I was invited to a one-day bootcamp at the Academy.
                            We played a number of games which required problem solving, attention to detail and efficiency. At this point I felt alive again because I was finally doing something that pushed me beyond my limits and had me on edge.

                            On the same day, individual interviews were conducted and I was so nervous that I thought I probably did not do so well after all.

                            To my surprise I was accepted for the <em>Life Skills</em> two week course which determined my success in the actual CodeSpace course. At this point I knew I had to give it my all. I was accepted for the course.

                            Thus far, I am very happy to say I have learned more than I thought I ever could about myself and about coding. I feel passionate and confident about what I have learnt and enjoy walking out of the Academy having learnt more each day.
